## Exercise 1

## Italics and Bold

### task1

---

> We'll start by learning two basic elements in text formatting: italics and bold. In these lessons, you'll notice some formatted red text; this text is actually written in Markdown! Regular Markdown doesn't look any different than regular text, but we're providing some highlighting to make it easier to see.
> To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, \_this_ word would become italic.
> For this next lesson, make the word "not" italic.

```
Writing in Markdown is _not_ that hard!
```

Writing in Markdown is _not_ that hard!

### task 2

---

> Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really\*\* get your point across.
> In the box below, make the word "will" bold.

```
I __will__ complete these lessons!
```

I **will** complete these lessons!

### task 3

---

> Of course, you can use _both italics and bold_ in the same line. You can also span them **across multiple words**.
> In the box below, make the words "Of course" italic, and the words "a little moxie" bold.

```
"*Of course*," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"
```

"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"

## task 4

---

> For the final exercise in this lesson, we're going to make some words bold and italic.
> In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or underscores. In the box below, make the words "This is unbelievable" both bold and italic. Place the asterisks **_on the outside_**, just to make it more legible.

```
If you're thinking to yourself, ***This is unbelievable***, you'd probably be right.
```

If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

## Headers

## task 1

---

> To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (# Header One), while for a header three, you'd use three (### Header Three).
> For this next lesson, make each header the right size.

```
# Header one
## Header two
### Header three
#### Header four
##### Header five
###### Header six
```

# Header one

## Header two

### Header three

#### Header four

##### Header five

###### Header six

## task 2

---

> It's up to you to decide when it's appropriate to use which header. In general, headers one and six should be used sparingly.
> You can't really make a header bold, but you can italicize certain words. In the box below, make the first line a heading level four, and italicize the name of the book:

```
#### Colombian Symbolism in _One Hundred Years of Solitude_

Here's some words about the book _One Hundred Years..._.
```

#### Colombian Symbolism in _One Hundred Years of Solitude_

Here's some words about the book _One Hundred Years..._.

## Links

## task 1

---

> There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).
> In the box below, make a link to www.google.com, with link text that says "Search for it."

```
[Search for it.](www.google.com)
```

[Search for it.](www.google.com)

## task 2

---

> You can add emphasis to link texts, if you like. In the box below, make the phrase "really, really" bold, and have the entire sentence link to www.dailykitten.com. You'll want to make sure that the bold phrasing occurs within the link text brackets.

```
[You're **really, really** going to want to see this.](www.dailykitten.com)
```

[You're **really, really** going to want to see this.](www.dailykitten.com)

## task 3

---

> Although it might make for an awkward experience, you can make links within headings, too.
> For this next tutorial, make the text a heading four, and turn the phrase "the BBC" into a link to www.bbc.com/news:

```
#### The Latest News from [the BBC](www.bbc.com/news):
```

#### The Latest News from [the BBC](www.bbc.com/news):

## task 4

Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: *VIVE L'IRLANDE*!

## BBCode
BBCode ("Bulletin Board Code") is a lightweight markup language used to format messages in much Internet forum software, first introduced by Coalson LLC. in 1998.
The available "tags" of BBCode are usually indicated by square brackets ([ and ]) surrounding a keyword, and are parsed before being translated into HTML.

## TeX
TeX is a typesetting system (or a “formatting system”) which was designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978.  

TeX is popular in academia, especially in mathematics, computer science, economics, engineering, linguistics, physics, statistics, and quantitative psychology.

It has largely displaced Unix troff, the other favored formatting system, in many Unix installations which use both for different purposes. It is also used for many other typesetting tasks, especially in the form of LaTeX, ConTeXt, and other macro packages.
